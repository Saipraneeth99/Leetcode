        "### Conceptual Logic\n",
        "This method seeks to divide a sorted array into subarrays of size 3 such that the maximum difference between any two elements in each subarray is less than or equal to a given threshold `k`. If this condition can't be met for any subarray, an empty array is returned.\n",

        "### Why This Approach?\n",
        "The approach makes use of the sorted property of arrays to ensure that the maximum difference is checked only between the first and last elements of each potential subarray. This is efficient because sorting guarantees that these are the minimum and maximum values of the subarray.\n",

        "### Problem Description\n",
        "Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward, and a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Problem Description\n",
        "Given an array `arr` and an integer `k`, the task is to find the least number of unique integers remaining after exactly `k` elements are removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Two Logical Approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Approach 1: Using a Min Heap\n",
        "1. **Logic**:\n",
        "    - Use a frequency counter (`Counter`) to count occurrences of each integer in `arr`.\n",
        "    - Convert the frequency counter into a min-heap based on counts to prioritize removal of integers with lower frequencies.\n",
        "    - Remove elements from the heap, starting with those with the lowest frequency, decrementing `k` by the count of occurrences for each removed element.\n",
        "    - If `k` becomes negative after a removal, this indicates the last removal only partially counted towards `k`, hence, one unique integer is still partially present, leading to an adjustment in the final count.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why This Approach?**:\n",
        "    - The min-heap ensures that integers with the lowest frequency are considered first for removal, minimizing the number of unique integers left.\n",
        "    - Efficiently handles scenarios where `k` does not exactly match the total occurrences of integers, requiring an adjustment in the count of unique integers left.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Approach 2: Sorting the Frequencies\n",
        "1. **Logic**:\n",
        "    - Again, use a frequency counter (`Counter`) for occurrences.\n",
        "    - Sort the values of the frequency counter to prioritize integers with lower frequencies.\n",
        "    - Iterate over the sorted frequencies, decrementing `k` by the frequency of each integer, to simulate removal.\n",
        "    - If at any point, the exact value of `k` matches a frequency, all subsequent integers are unique and are counted towards the final total. If `k` is less than a frequency, it indicates partial removal, and all integers including and following the current are counted as remaining unique integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why This Approach?**:\n",
        "    - Sorting frequencies allows for a simple, iterative approach to decrement `k` and determine how many unique integers can be removed.\n",
        "    - This method is straightforward and leverages sorted frequencies to efficiently identify the point at which further removals cannot be made without leaving partial integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Approach 1 (Min Heap)**:\n",
        "    - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for heap operations, where `n` is the number of unique integers.\n",
        "    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the frequency counter and heap.\n",
        "- **Approach 2 (Sorting Frequencies)**:\n",
        "    - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the frequency values.\n",
        "    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the frequency counter and sorted list of frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches offer a method to minimize the number of unique integers after `k` removals, with the choice between them depending on preferences for data structures (heap vs. sorted list) and the specific details of implementation efficiency in the given context."

        "Given an array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, along with a certain number of bricks and ladders, you start from building `0` and can move to the next building using bricks or ladders. Bricks can be used to overcome height differences between buildings, while ladders can be used to bypass any height difference. The goal is to find the furthest building you can reach using bricks and ladders optimally.\n",

        "   - Iterate through each building, calculating the height difference (`diff`) to the next building.\n",
        "   - If moving up, push the negative of the height difference (`-diff`) onto a min-heap. This keeps track of all upward moves in a way that allows us to easily swap out the largest height differences for ladders later.\n",
        "   - Deduct the height difference from the bricks. If you run out of bricks (`bricks < 0`), use a ladder to replace the largest used bricks (the smallest value in the negative heap), effectively optimizing the use of ladders for the largest gaps.\n",
        "   - Continue until you run out of bricks and ladders or reach the end of the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why This Approach?**:\n",
        "   - This approach ensures that ladders are reserved for the largest gaps, maximizing the distance that can be covered. It is an optimal strategy because using ladders for smaller gaps could prevent reaching further buildings that require overcoming larger gaps.\n",
