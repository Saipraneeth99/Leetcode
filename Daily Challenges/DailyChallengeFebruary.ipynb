        "\n",
        "### Conceptual Logic\n",
        "This method seeks to divide a sorted array into subarrays of size 3 such that the maximum difference between any two elements in each subarray is less than or equal to a given threshold `k`. If this condition can't be met for any subarray, an empty array is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Approach?\n",
        "The approach makes use of the sorted property of arrays to ensure that the maximum difference is checked only between the first and last elements of each potential subarray. This is efficient because sorting guarantees that these are the minimum and maximum values of the subarray.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), assuming the sort operation has already been done, where n is the number of elements in the array. The iteration through the array adds a linear term.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. This is for storing the `solution`, which in the worst case, will contain all elements of `nums` divided into subarrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Name\n",
        "The algorithm used here could be described as a \"Sorted Array Partitioning\" approach since it involves partitioning a sorted array into valid subarrays based on a given difference condition.\n"
