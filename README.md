# LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode Journey repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing my progress, solutions, and learnings as I tackle coding challenges on LeetCode. Whether you're preparing for interviews or just looking to improve your coding skills, I hope you find these solutions helpful.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into different folders to make navigation easier. Here's a quick overview:

### Daily Challenges

The `Daily Challenges` folder is where I upload solutions to the daily problems provided by LeetCode. These challenges range in difficulty from easy to hard and cover a wide array of topics in algorithms and data structures.

### Weekly Challenges

In the `Weekly Challenges` folder, you'll find solutions to the weekly contest problems starting from February. 

### Top Interview Questions

- **Week 1:** The first week is dedicated to tackling problems from the "Top Interview Questions" list curated by LeetCode. This list includes essential problems that frequently appear in technical interviews and are vital for anyone preparing for an upcoming interview. In the `Week 1` folder, you'll find a collection of solutions and explanations to few problems based on my understanding and enriched with the support of ChatGPT.
- **Week 2:** The second week is dedicated to few core concepts and math related problems
This aims to enhance the clarity and accessibility of the material, ensuring it serves as a robust resource for anyone on their interview preparation journey.
