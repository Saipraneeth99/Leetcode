        "### Conceptual Logic\n",
        "The method identifies the first bad version in a sequence of versions using a binary search approach. It narrows down the range by repeatedly checking the midpoint version until it finds the transition from good to bad versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Approach?\n",
        "Binary search is optimal for this problem because it reduces the search space exponentially at each step, offering a much faster solution than a linear search. Since versions are sorted by number, binary search can be applied effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the number of versions. Binary search cuts the search space in half with each iteration.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The space used is constant as the operation only requires a few integer variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Name\n",
        "This algorithm is a \"Modified Binary Search\" as it tweaks the standard binary search to accommodate the specific condition of finding the first occurrence of a bad version."
