        "\n",
        "### Conceptual Logic\n",
        "This method constructs a height-balanced binary search tree (BST) from a sorted array by recursively selecting the middle element as the root and applying the same process to the subarrays for creating left and right subtrees, ensuring minimal height.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element is visited once to create a corresponding node.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for the recursive stack space (not considering the output tree space), which corresponds to the height of the tree. In the case of a balanced BST, the height is log n.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Traversal Type\n",
        "- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**. This approach employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, akin to DFS, where each recursive call handles a portion of the array and constructs part of the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Approach?\n",
        "Selecting the middle element of the sorted array as the root at each step ensures the resulting BST is balanced. This recursive strategy divides the problem into smaller subproblems, each responsible for constructing a part of the tree, effectively utilizing the sorted property of the array to satisfy BST conditions while also maintaining balance to minimize the tree's height.\n"
