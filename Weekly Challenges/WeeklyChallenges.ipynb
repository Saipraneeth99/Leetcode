        "### Conceptual Logic\n",
        "This method generates all possible states of a string representing a row of dominoes by flipping any two adjacent \"++\" into \"--\". It scans through the current state string and applies the flip transformation whenever the condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Approach?\n",
        "The approach is essentially scanning through the string with a window of size two (the \"++\" pattern). When a match is found, the string is altered to produce a new state, which is a classic case of string manipulation based on pattern matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `currentState` string. Each character (except the last one) is visited once.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of possible moves, and n is the length of the string. This is because each solution is a new string of length n.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Name\n",
        "Approach: Linear Iteration\" as it involves Linearly Iterating over the given string. # From Editorial\n"
