        "### Conceptual Logic\n",
        "This method generates all possible states of a string representing a row of dominoes by flipping any two adjacent \"++\" into \"--\". It scans through the current state string and applies the flip transformation whenever the condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Approach?\n",
        "The approach is essentially scanning through the string with a window of size two (the \"++\" pattern). When a match is found, the string is altered to produce a new state, which is a classic case of string manipulation based on pattern matching.\n",

        "### Logical Approach\n",
        "To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach is used. The key insight is that for any post `i`, you can either paint it the same color as the previous one (with certain restrictions) or a different color. The total ways to paint `i` posts depend on the decisions made for the previous two posts due to the constraint of not having more than two consecutive posts with the same color.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dynamic Programming Formula\n",
        "- If `i == 1`, there are `k` ways to paint the post (since there are no restrictions).\n",
        "- If `i == 2`, each post can be painted in `k` ways, resulting in `k * k` total combinations.\n",
        "- For `i > 2`, the number of ways to paint the `i`th post is:\n",
        "  - `(k - 1) * total_ways(i - 1)`: Painting the `i`th post a different color than the `(i-1)`th post.\n",
        "  - `(k - 1) * total_ways(i - 2)`: Painting the `i`th post the same color as the `(i-1)`th post but ensuring `(i-2)`th post is a different color to avoid three consecutive same colors.\n",
        "\n",
        "These cases are combined because, for any post, you're choosing between `k-1` colors different from the immediate previous post, accounting for both the scenarios where the last two were the same or different.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation\n",
        "Memoization is used to store the results of subproblems to avoid recalculating them, optimizing the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of posts. Each post calculation is done once due to memoization.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation\n",
        "This solution methodically calculates the number of ways to paint the fence while adhering to the given constraints, using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach facilitated by memoization to ensure efficiency and avoid recalculations of the same subproblems."
